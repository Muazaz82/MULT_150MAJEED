Improving the Game 
1. Is the game too Easy or Hard?
The game takes a lot of skills and thinking, so it isn't easy but it isn't impossible to complete.
2. What would make it easier or harder?
To make the game easier, there should be a tool button for the player to use when they are stuck on it
like a tutorial button. This game is trippy and can confuse a few people so having that feature can be helpful.
3. What would give it a "Wow" factor?
In order for the game to get a "Wow" factor, adding a lot of random shapes and vibrant color will make it more 
appealing for the player.
4. What part of the game are fun? What part of the game are Tedious?
The fun part of the game is when you see the ball moving in a very unique and random way.
The tedious part of the game is the way the cube is moving, it doesn't have a motionless 
movement which can be a little difficult to work with.
